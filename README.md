# Sentiment Analyzer 
This sentiment analyzer is intended to be used by individuals who would like to partake into sentiment analysis from a csv file. To easier usage, it uses functions which facilitates in knowing where to change the code to your own data. It reads one column of a dataset, labels the data as negative (-1), neutral (0), or positive (1), then conducts basic analysis (a bar graph and counting how many times a the labels appear in the data). More features may be added later. 

### Important
The intention of this code is to teach people with no background in programming how to code, therefore, you can expect a considerable large amount of comments. 

## How to Get Started 
To run the program you need to install Python on your device, [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OjkpXE75umB3emWzfELojzxcUQ4R9uC7/view?usp=drive_link) will walk you through the process and ensure pip is installed successfully. After installing python, you need to install a couple of libraries inside of python, [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMctNjDmhGbm0DLDBmUB0nbd6buY7r9T/view?usp=drive_link) contains all the information regarding those. 

## Tutorial
The [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-_4L7ftjKDvldY99Z6zklQArWJiHAidg/view?usp=drive_link) walks you through the process of writing the code, providing tips in how to approach each block of code.

## Credits
The basis for this sentiment analyzer comes from this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VZhog5C3bU&t=544s) by Patrick Loeber. The data used to demonstrate how the code works comes from Tarık Kaan Koç, who posted it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tarkkaanko/amazon?rvi=1), which is under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which it prohibits the usage of the data for commercial purposes.
