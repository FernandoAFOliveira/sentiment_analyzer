# <b> Sentiment Analyzer</b>

## Overview

The Sentiment Analyzer is a robust, user-friendly tool for sentiment analysis from CSV files. Our focus is to provide an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) suitable for users with little to no programming background. The application reads a specified column from a dataset, classifies the data into negative, neutral, or positive sentiments, and visualizes the analysis through dynamic bar graphs.

## Features
